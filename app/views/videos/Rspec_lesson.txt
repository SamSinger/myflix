thinking in user stories
happy path is more inportant for writing tests than the unhappy path

anytime a bug is fixed, write a test for it.
don't test duplications
A bad or partial or broken test are problems. fix or remove
Keep test suite often.
Everytime you commit if you have other people contributing.
Write no brittle test.

rake db: migrate db:test:prepare (check that all migrations run

WARNING: db:test:prepare is deprecated. The Rails test helper 
now maintains your test schema automatically, 
see the release notes for details.
